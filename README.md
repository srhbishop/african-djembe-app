# african-djembe-app
A music ed page that introduces the West African djembe drum and allows users to play the different sounds with either click or on the keyboard

In the future, would like to fix the video focus so that the user can play immediately along with the video (right now, the user has to click outside the video first).
Also may add more drums/sounds, like the dundunba, to enhance educational use.
